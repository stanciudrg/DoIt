# Do It

Do It is a vanilla JavaScript and CSS only app that saves your progress on the current browser using localStorage. 
For now, it allows you to do the following:

- Create, edit, and delete Todos
- Search for Todos
- Create, rename, and delete Categores
- Sort and/or filter Categories

Additionally, Do It keeps track of time and verifies the due date of your Todos to determine whether they became 'overdue' as time went on. It then applies visual changes for you to be easier to differentiate between 'due' and 'overdue' todos.
Todos are also manually moved in and out of the 'Today' and 'Next 7 days' Categories when needed.

This app is a work in progress, and more features will be added in the future.
